This repository contains living specifications for Octopus Deploy features.

It will follow the styling / layout conventions [defined in the docs repository](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/docs/blob/master/README.md). Inspired by [Painless Functional Specifications](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/03/painless-functional-specifications-part-2-whats-a-spec/)

## Objectives
 - A collection of *functional* and *technical* specifications that will be kept up to date as we build non-trivial features.
 - Describe user stories / scenarios for a variety of types of stakeholders
 - Receive, manage and discuss feedback from feature stakeholders
 
 
## Contributing

We are welcoming contribution, either through:

 - Posting questions / joining in on the discussion of issues 
 - Raising issues
 - Submitting PRs for changes to the SPECs
