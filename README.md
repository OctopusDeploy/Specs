This repository contains living specifications for Octopus Deploy features.

It will follow the styling / layout conventions [defined in the docs repository](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/docs/blob/master/README.md). Inspired by [Painless Functional Specifications]https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/03/painless-functional-specifications-part-2-whats-a-spec/)

## Objectives
 - A collection of *functional* and *tecnical* specifications that will be kept up to date as we build non-trivial features.
 - Receive, manage and discuss feedback from feature stakeholders
