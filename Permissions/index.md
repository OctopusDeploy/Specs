# Permissions

As part of implementing Spaces, the existing permission model will need to be modified.

Two proposals were considered.

A [simplified model](SimplifiedPermissions.md) was proposed, but on closer consideration there was deemed to be no viable migration strategy and significant risk of alienating existing customers. 

A [less radical approach](Permissions-PlanB.md) was agreed upon.
